  ## Installation
  Fork this repo into your GitHub. Make sure the fork process has been completed without any issue by checking all files in your forked repo. Verify wheter you have node.js installed on your desktop or not by running the command `node -v` in your terminal.

  Once you completed the installation process, try to run `npm start`, it will probably give you an error BECAUSE the required dependencies are not installed yet into the root directory. Run npm install to install required dependancies (check package.json). Then, you should be able to run `npm start`.
